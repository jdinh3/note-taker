# note-taker
## Description
  This application allows a user to take notes and save them within the application. The home page includes a button that directs the user to the notes page where the user will be able to type in notes and a title. When the save button is pressed, the notes will be saved to the side of the page and will persist when the page is refreshed.

  Here are screen shots of the application. [Homepage](assets/localhost_8080_(webpage).png)
